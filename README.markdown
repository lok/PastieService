PastieService - A Mac OS X Service to quickly paste on pastie.org
=================================================================

PastieService is a service provider for Mac OS X (10.6 only) written by Samuel
Mendes in Objective-C 2.0 and released under BSD 3-clauses license.

This service provides a quick way to paste any selected text in Mac OS X to
[pastie.org](http://pastie.org). Once pasted the paste's URL is automatically
placed in the system's clipboard.

Installation
------------

Once build place PastieService.app either in /Applications or
~/Library/Services. Then run:

  sudo /System/Library/CoreServices/pbs

This will update the cache of service providers.
Finally open up System Preferences go into Keyboard and choose the Keyboard
Shortcuts tab. On the left side are the categories, choose Services. On the
right is a list of all the services you can activate. Find "Make New Pastie" in
it (it's probably at the end in the Development section) and activate it.

You can assign it a keyboard shortcut by right clicking on right side of the
list.
